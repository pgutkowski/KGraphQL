I am no longer able to maintain this project. Please go to https://github.com/aPureBase/KGraphQL, where KGraphQL is still developed.

KGraphQL is [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) implementation of [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/). It provides rich DSL to setup GraphQL schema. 

## Introduction

As example, let's partially reproduce part of Star Wars schema from [official GraphQL tutorial](http://graphql.org/learn/queries/). First, we need to define our domain model, by plain kotlin classes: 

```kotlin
enum class Episode {
    NEWHOPE, EMPIRE, JEDI
}

interface Character {
    val id : String
    val name : String?
    val friends: List<Character>
    val appearsIn: Set<Episode>
}

data class Human (
        override val id: String,
        override val name: String?,
        override val friends: List<Character>,
        override val appearsIn: Set<Episode>,
        val homePlanet: String,
        val height: Double
) : Character

data class Droid (
        override val id: String,
        override val name: String?,
        override val friends: List<Character>,
        override val appearsIn: Set<Episode>,
        val primaryFunction : String
) : Character
```
Next, we define our data 
``` kotlin
val luke = Human("2000", "Luke Skywalker", emptyList(), Episode.values().toSet(), "Tatooine", 1.72)

val r2d2 = Droid("2001", "R2-D2", emptyList(), Episode.values().toSet(), "Astromech")
```

Then, we can create schema:

``` kotlin
//KGraphQL#schema { } is entry point to create KGraphQL schema
val schema = KGraphQL.schema {

        //configure method allows you customize schema behaviour
        configure {
            useDefaultPrettyPrinter = true
        }

        //create query "hero" which returns instance of Character
        query("hero") {
            resolver {episode: Episode -> when(episode){
                Episode.NEWHOPE, Episode.JEDI -> r2d2
                Episode.EMPIRE -> luke
            }}
        }
    
        //create query "heroes" which returns list of luke and r2d2
        query("heroes") {
            resolver{ -> listOf(luke, r2d2)}
        }

        //kotlin classes need to be registered with "type" method 
        //to be included in created schema type system
        //class Character is automatically included, 
        //as it is return type of both created queries  
        type<Droid>()
        type<Human>()
        enum<Episode>()
    }
```
Now, we can query our schema:
```kotlin
//query for hero from episode JEDI and take id, name for any Character, and primaryFunction for Droid or height for Human
schema.execute("{hero(episode: JEDI){
                    id
                    name 
                    ... on Droid{primaryFunction} 
                    ... on Human{height}
                    }
                }")
```
Returns:
```json
{
  "data" : {
    "hero" : {
      "id" : "2001",
      "name" : "R2-D2",
      "primaryFunction" : "Astromech"
    }
  }
}
```
Query for all heroes:
```kotlin
//query for all heroes and take id, name for any Character, and primaryFunction for Droid or height for Human
schema.execute("{heroes {
                    id 
                    name 
                    ... on Droid{primaryFunction} 
                    ... on Human{height}
                    }
                }")
```
Returns:
```json
{
  "data" : {
    "heroes" : [ {
      "id" : "2000",
      "name" : "Luke Skywalker",
      "height" : 1.72
    }, {
      "id" : "2001",
      "name" : "R2-D2",
      "primaryFunction" : "Astromech"
    } ]
  }
}
```
As stated by GraphQL specification, client receives only what is requested. No more, no less.

Detailed documentation can be found in [wiki](https://github.com/pgutkowski/KGraphQL/wiki). For more examples, see KGraphQL demo application: [KGraphQL-NBA2012](https://github.com/pgutkowski/KGraphQL-NBA2012)
